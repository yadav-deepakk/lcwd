 * -----------------------------------
 * `class` and `object`
 * `class` - class is a blueprint to create an object
 * it consists of properties behaviours/methods.
 *
 * `object` - Instances of a class representing a real-
 * world entity is known as object.
 * -----------------------------------
 *
 *
 * -----------------------------------
 * OOPs - Object Oriented Programming
 * -----------------------------------
 *  1) Polymorphism
 *  Polymorphism is a term made from `poly` and `merons`.
 *  One thing present in many forms is known as polymorphism
 *   - i) early binding (method overloading)
 *   - ii) late binding (method overriding)
 *
 *  2) Inheritance
 *  It is a way through which child/sub class can aquire
 *  behaviors and properties of parent/super class.
 *    - i) Single level - single parent class is used to
 *    inherit the properties to derive child
 *    - ii) Multi level - a class is derived using a derived
 *    class
 *    - iii) Hierarchial - multiple child classes inherting the
 *    properties and methods of a single parent creating a
 *    hierarchy
 *
 *  4) Encapsulation
 *  Binding all members into a single unit class is known as
 *  encapsulation
 *
 *  3) Abstraction
 *  Hiding the behaviors by only giving the abstract declarations
 *  is known as Abstraction. This is acheived using interfaces and
 *  abstract classes in java.
